# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a ligtweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Why do we use Markdown?

-- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
-- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

The symbol to use when creating a heading is the hashtag symbol,"#".
To create the largest heading you use one hashtag. To make the smallest heading we would use 6.

When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use the star symbol,"*".

##How do you create a link with Markdown?

To create a link with Markdown you put the title of your link inside of square brackets and the link address inside of parenthesis.
