1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

In realms of digital dance, they meet,
Through tangled wires and pathways fleet,
HTTP, the messenger's grace,
Sends data's whispers from place to place.

A tale of packets, swift and true,
In bytes and bits, they bid adieu,
From sender's heart to distant shore,
HTTP's magic starts to soar.

With verbs like 'GET' and 'POST' to wield,
The quest for knowledge is revealed,
Across the vast expanse they roam,
In zeroes, ones, they find their home.

A dance of headers, hand in hand,
Requests and responses, they command,
With status codes and MIME's embrace,
They paint the canvas of cyberspace.

Round firewalls, they nimbly glide,
Through routers' gates, they don't abide,
Ensnared in proxies' gentle hold,
Their destination, they unfold.

Like messengers of ones and naughts,
They traverse lands and digital plots,
HTTP's symphony of strings,
A symphony that always sings.
