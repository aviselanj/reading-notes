#Growth Mindset
Growth mindset to me means staying persist in your path. There were so many times that I could have given up on coding, so many limiting beliefs that I had to contend with. How can I code to code with only a cellphone? Why am I unable to code from my new laptop? Why is it taking me so long to learn? Those are just a few questions that could have took me off my path but persistance has led me to CodeX Academy and persistance will take me to the land of my dreams, where the mind never stops learning, never stops creating, and never stops growing.
