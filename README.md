## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is a mindset that is always in a constant state of progression. It means to never stop learning and getting better. I believe that every mind has a growth mindset and will grow whatever seeds we plant. 
### 3 reminders on how to keep a growth mindset
1. Be persistant
2. Mistakes are opprotunities for learning
3. Remember that you are always learning
